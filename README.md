# About me 👋

<!--
**barryeastenders/barryeastenders** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

🚗 **Currently working on...**\
    Tryin' to automate the inventory at the car lot, ain't I? Fingers crossed it don't end up sendin' all our motors to Walford East station by mistake!

🌱 **Currently learning...**\
    Python (ain't no snakes involved, thank gawd), SQL (sounds like a dodgy geezer's name if you ask me), and this Google Cloud malarkey. Proper confusin', but I'm givin' it a go!

⚡️ **Ask me about...**\
    How to shift a motor with a dodgy gearbox, the best caff in Albert Square, or why me code's always tellin' me there's a "syntax error". What's syntax ever done to me, eh?

P.S. If you see Mick, don't tell 'im I'm moonlightin' as a tech geek, alright? He already thinks I'm barmy enough as it is!
